TTCSP Think Tank Query and Database Demos

The Middle East and North Africa Team of Summer 2017 attempted to create a database and query that would analyize the think tanks in their region and provide statistics and graphs on the think tanks of their region. While they completed this application, more features were request and the final program could not be completed within our time frame.

We would like to share the progress we made to future interns with the program.

Included in this file are the three builds of the program. One is Working, which works as intended but without the final features. The other two are two separate builds that attempted to add the final features to the program.

If you desire further information, please consult our lead programmer James Woolley at the provided emails. A link to a video explaining the working version of the program is also included.
